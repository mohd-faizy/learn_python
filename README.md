Python is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language.It was created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1991**. Python programming language (*latest Python 3*) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well suited for Beginners, also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and Java.

**Below are some facts about Python Programming Language:**

  1. Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose,high-level programming language.
  2. Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.
  3. Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java.
    Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language,makes
    them readable all the time.
  4. Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like-Google,Amazon,
    Facebook,Instagram,Dropbox,Uber ... etc.
  5. The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the
    following:

     - *Machine Learning GUI Applications(like Kivy,Tkinter,PyQt etc.)*
     - *Web frameworks like Django(used by YouTube,Instagram,Dropbox)*
     - *Image processing(like OpenCV,Pillow)*
     - *Web scraping(like Scrapy,BeautifulSoup,Selenium)*
     - *Test frameworks*
     - *Multimedia*
     - *Scientific computing*
     - *Text processing and many more ..*
## Python Advantages and Disadvantages – 
### **Advantages of Python**: 
1. Presence of third-party modules 
2. Extensive support libraries(**NumPy** for numerical calculations, **Pandas** for data analytics, etc.) 
3. Open source and large active community base 
4. Versatile, Easy to read, learn and write
5. User-friendly data structures 
6. High-level language 
7. Dynamically typed language(No need to mention data type based on the value assigned, it takes data type) 
8. Object-Oriented and Procedural  Programming language
Portable and Interactive
9. Ideal for prototypes – provide more functionality with less coding
10. Highly Efficient(Python’s clean object-oriented design provides enhanced process control, and the language is equipped with excellent text processing and integration capabilities, as well as its own unit testing framework, which makes it more efficient.)
11. Internet of Things(IoT) Opportunities
12. Interpreted Language
13. Portable across Operating systems

### **Disadvantages of Python**:

1. **Slow Speed**
We discussed above that Python is an interpreted language and dynamically-typed language. The line by line execution of code often leads to slow execution. The dynamic nature of Python is also responsible for the slow speed of Python because it has to do the extra work while executing code. So, Python is not used for purposes where speed is an important aspect of the project.

2. **Not Memory Efficient**
To provide simplicity to the developer, Python has to do a little tradeoff. The Python programming language uses a large amount of memory. This can be a disadvantage while building applications when we prefer memory optimization.

3. **Weak in Mobile Computing**
Python is generally used in server-side programming. We don’t get to see Python on the client-side or mobile applications because of the following reasons. Python is not memory efficient and it has slow processing power as compared to other languages.

4. **Database Access**
Programming in Python is easy and stress-free. But when we are interacting with the database, it lacks behind. The Python’s database access layer is primitive and underdeveloped in comparison to the popular technologies like JDBC and ODBC. Huge enterprises need smooth interaction of complex legacy data and Python is thus rarely used in enterprises.

1. **Runtime Errors**
As we know Python is a dynamically typed language so the data type of a variable can change anytime. A variable containing integer number may hold a string in the future, which can lead to Runtime Errors.

Therefore Python programmers need to perform thorough testing of the applications.

### **Applications**:

1. GUI-based desktop applications
2. Graphic design, image processing applications, Games, and Scientific/ computational Applications
3. Web frameworks and applications 
4. Enterprise and Business applications 
5. Operating Systems 
6. Education
7. Database Access
8. Language Development 
9. Prototyping 
10. Software Developmen


### **Organizations using Python**:

1. Google(Components of Google spider and Search Engine)
2. Yahoo(Maps)
3. YouTube
4. Mozilla
5. Dropbox
6. Microsoft
7. Cisco
8. Spotify
9. Quora
10. Facebook


### **LANGUAGE FEATURES**

#### **Interpreted:**
There are no separate compilation and execution steps likeCandC++.
- Directly run the program from the source code.
- Internally,Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes which is then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.
- No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries,etc.
#### **Platform Independent:**
- Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system
platforms.
- Python can be used on Linux,Windows,Macintosh,Solaris and many more.

#### **Free and Open Source:** Redistributable
#### **High-level Language:**
- In Python,no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the
memory used by the program.
#### **Simple:**
- Closer to English language;Easy to Learn.
- More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax.
#### **Embeddable:**
- Python can be used with in C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the
program's users.
#### **Robust:**:
- Exceptional handling features
- Memory management techniques in built
#### **Rich Library Support:**
- The Python Standard Library is very vast.
- Known as the"batteries included"philosophy of Python;It can help do various things involving regular expressions,documentation generation,unit testing, threading,databases,web browsers CGI,email,XML,HTML,WAV files, cryptography,GUI and many more.
- Besides the standard library,there are various other high-quality libraries such as the Python Imaging Library which is an amazingly simple image manipulation library.
